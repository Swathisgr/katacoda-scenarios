Now, we will make changes in our .json file.<br>

We already have a reference json file. We just need to replace the current json file with the reference one. For doing so, execute the following commands.
<br>`rm -rf ~/Source/CDH/cdh514.json`{{execute}}
<br>`cp ~/test/cdh515.json ~/Source/CDH/`{{execute}}

To view the content of the file, execute the following
<br>`cat ~/Source/CDH/cdh515.json`{{execute}}
